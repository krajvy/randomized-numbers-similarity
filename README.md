# Test similarity of randomized numbers

JavaScript for display how are random numbers distribued through array.
Usefull when you want to check how your browser random function works, otherwise just for interesting color map of numbers. And also for fun.

## Configuration

In index.html you can set up a few values for better output

```JavaScript
// 50 = random maximum value, length of an array, x coordinates
// 1000 = number of cycles when values are filling array, y coordinates
// 2 = how many times should be filled one row with random numbers, colourfulness
random.fillRandomTable(50, 1000, 2);
```
